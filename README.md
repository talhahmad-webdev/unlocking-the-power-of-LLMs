# Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive overview of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ecosystem. It explains how modern AI systems understand and generate human language using advanced techniques such as transformers, attention mechanisms, and context engineering.

## Problem Statement
Modern AI systems require efficient methods to understand, process, and generate human language. Traditional systems are limited in understanding context, reasoning, and complex instructions. This project explains how LLMs solve these problems using modern architectures and learning techniques.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To explain the basic concept of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- To understand how tokenization and vectorization work
- To explain transformers and attention mechanisms
- To study RAG, AI agents, and different types of models
- To understand modern optimization techniques like distillation and quantization

## Methodology
This project is based on a conceptual and theoretical study of modern AI systems. The information is presented in the form of slides and documentation covering the working of LLMs, their components, and their applications.
